# RISC-V

## Overview
This project aims to develop a microarchitecture for the RISC-V RV32I ISA and some of standard extensions for accelerating DSP and cryptography applications

## Progress
- Multiplication and division units: completed
- Datapath for RV32IM: completed
- Testing: compiling correctly, errors in simulation
- Floating-Point Unit: in progress
- Vector processor implementation and cryptography cores: needs work
  
## TODO
- Debug RV32IM datapath and controller
- Convernt multicycle design to pipelined
