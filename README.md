# RISC-V

## Overview
This project aims to develop a microarchitecture for the RISC-V RV32I ISA and some of standard extensions for accelerating DSP and cryptography applications

## Progress
- Multiplication and division units: completed
- Floating-Point Unit: in progress
- Vector processor implementation and cryptography cores: needs work
  
## TODO
- Test R-Type instructions for RV32IM
